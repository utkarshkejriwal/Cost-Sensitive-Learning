# Cost-Sensitive Learning
This project aims to predict whether a loan applicant has a good or bad credit score by utilizing two different cost matrices. The objective is to compare various classifiers and assess the impact of incorporating a cost matrix into the prediction process.

## Dataset
The project uses the "German Credit" dataset, which is provided in the ARFF (Attribute-Relation File Format) file named german credit.arff. This dataset contains information about loan applicants, including various attributes relevant to credit scoring.

## Notebook
The analysis and implementation are documented in the Jupyter Notebook titled Cost Sensitive Learning.ipynb. This notebook includes:

### Data Preprocessing: Steps to clean and prepare the dataset for modeling.
### Model Training: Implementation of different classifiers to predict credit scores.
### Cost Matrices: Definition and application of two distinct cost matrices to evaluate the impact on classifier performance.
### Evaluation: Comparison of classifier results with and without the application of cost matrices to understand their effects.
### Getting Started
To explore the analysis and results:

#### Clone the Repository: Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
